# Data-Analysis-For-Online-Retail-Dataset-
In this repository, I've started to analyze an Online Retail Dataset. Until this time, I completed my analyses on Excel and SQL. Please review:
* **1. Online_Retail (Very First Dataset)**
* **2. Online_Retail (Arranged-0-1-2-3)**
* **3. Online_Retail_Outlier_Handling_Final_Dataset**
* **4. SQLQuery1**
* **5. Customer Segmentation with RFM**
* **6. Additional Table for Analysis**
respectively

#### Please review files for details

### Business Understanding & Completed Stages
Let's suppose that this company's staff want to understand their customers' behaviors and want to campaign for their customers who are about to leave. Also they want to find and campaign for their customers who brought the most money to them. Also, to increase their profit, they want to find whether there are some associations between the products that bought by their customers. These will be their goals.

So far, I've finished 
*  **1. Business Understanding**
*  **2. Data Understanding**
*  **3. Data Preparation**
*  **4. Segmenting Customers with Rule Based Clustering (Rule Based Segmentation with RFM calculation, by using SQL on SSMS)**

### My Goals for the Project

I will be performing
* **1. Some analyses and EDA on Python**
* **2. Clustering Algorithms (K-Means and Hierarchical)**
* **3. Recommendation Systems with Appriori Algorithm**
* **4. Data Visualization on PowerBI**
